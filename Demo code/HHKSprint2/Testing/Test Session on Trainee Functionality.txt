-----------------------------------------------
#ISSUE 1
Keep coming up against usernames and passwords that should work that don't - eg richard.scott - will get an updated list from devs after session. Need to do this to properly test valid/invalid logins

#ISSUE 2
Title of job should perhaps be at the top of the job as is confusing which job it is

#ISSUE 3
Could have phone numbers for account managers and consultants/trainees too. They would need to be able to update these.

#ISSUE 4
How to update details is confusing. Needs to be looked at. Will explain to dev
